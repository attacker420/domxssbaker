With potential DOM XSS findings from Burp Plugins, we end up reading complex JavaScript codes.   At the end of the day, majority of DOM XSS come from location/href objects appended with # hag.  

This little script takes a list of URLs (which you can copy from Burp) and make a unique list and open your default browser every 15 seconds interval  or interval of your choice.
